When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To collaborate with other people.
    To save things remotely
    To work from more than one computer (collaborate with myself)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manual pull ensures that you don't get something you don't want, and that
    you know what you do get.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A clone is a copy of a repository, made either local-to-local, or
    GitHub-to-local. 
    A fork is a specific kind of clone, GitHub-to-Github.
    A branch is a separate, but still attached, version of part (or all) of a
    repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Merges will be much faster, plus you are merging with the latest version,
    unless you choose an earlier version. The option to merge with an earlier
    version is available if needed/wanted.
