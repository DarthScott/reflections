What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
An empty record of that repository is created. You will have to manually make the first commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it
offers?
The staging area isn't where you do things (like edit) to a file, but is more like a holding area for future commits.
It shows you what you're working on 'right now', as far as git is concerned.
